# Graph Neural Network for Heat Transfer Problem

This example was originally hosted [here](https://github.com/matlab-deep-learning/Graph-Neural-Network-for-Heat-Transfer-Problem).

In recent years, graph neural networks [1] have been applied to various types of application tasks. 
This example shows how to train a graph neural network using data calculated with partial differential equations (PDEs) to predict temperature distributions.
